# THE CORONA CHRONICLE
This is a basic front-end website that involves the use of technologies like HTML, CSS and Bootstrap library. This website/webpage was built by me in May 2021, with help in UI Design from my friend Bhavil Ahuja. This was my official entry in HackDTU; an inter college hackathon organised by IOSD-DTU (International Organisation of Software Developers DTU Chapter). The main focus here was to provide a simple but easy on the eyes User Interface.

Here, with a help of some clever word plays we tried to bring all the important links related to COVID-19 pandemic in one place.
